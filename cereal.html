      <h2>Krave</h2>
      <p>
        Krave is a chocolate cereal made by the Kellogg Company, launched in the UK in 2010 and marketed under the slogan "Taste Unleashed", later "Here Choccy Choccy" or "It's Time To Melt".
      </p>
      <p>
        Krave is crunchy without being exceedingly so (think Chex or Lays potato chips rather than Cap'n Crunch or kettle chips), and the outer shell's lightly crunchy texture and its lightly sweetened taste work well together.
      </p>
